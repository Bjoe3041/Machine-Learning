# Machine-Learning
A system that can train new Machine Learning models, based on data from a postgreSQL database. Allows you to create new models easily and name them. Includes a GUI to make it even easier to create new models.
It connects to an API that returns a list of Articles, and using those articles it trains the model. It also functions as an API to use the models on JSON objects being sent to the API.

This system makes it as easy as can be to create new models whenever you want. And it also combines all models in program so there doesn't need to be a new project for each model trained.
